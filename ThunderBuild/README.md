### Instructions
- The config is called ```BrutalCompanyPlus.cfg```
- The location of this config can be found based on your Thunderstore Mod Manager Profile Directory
	- You can navigate to this location by following the following instructions
		- Goto the profile that contains "Brutal Company Plus"
		- Click Settings in the left panel
		- Click the TAB "Locations"
		- Click "Browse profile folder"
	- Now you can navigate the directory that was open to get to the ```BrutalCompanyPlus.cfg```
		- The path you navigate to is ```BepInEx\config\```
		- Open the ```BrutalCompanyPlus.cfg``` and adjust to your liking!
		
### IMPORTANT
- If you made modifications to the config be sure not to make any typos and follow the logic, any mistakes will lead to total mod failure
- If you changed events around and experience and issue where only event "None" occurs it could be due to a config issue.
		
		
## Notes
- As of now this is a HOST ONLY mod, clients will not need this mod at all to enjoy the experience.
- I will be adding tons of new events as much as I can.
